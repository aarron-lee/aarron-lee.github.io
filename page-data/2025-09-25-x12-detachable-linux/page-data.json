The Lenovo pen is even recognized in Waydroid, which was a pleasant surprise. I can do erase actions in apps like Anki in Waydroid.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately there’s a very limited selection of x86 tablets, and even fewer that are compatible with Linux. But if you can get an x12 detachable for a good price, I’d say that even in 2025 this is a solid tablet option.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Long Term Review of the Lenovo Thinkpad x12 Detachable Gen 1 with Linux","date":"September 25, 2025","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-22-laptop-search-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Search for an Ideal Linux Laptop, Part 2"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2b2c9294-dcc0-540c-9911-cda15361ee04","previousPostId":"61e709a5-9fba-52fa-a89e-74d564cd4f6a","nextPostId":null}},
