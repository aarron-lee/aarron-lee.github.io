They're awesome.</p>\n<p>If I had to distill what I discovered about docker into a few key points, it would be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It lets you create isolated environments, each with it's own set of isolated dependencies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can configure these environments as code, which means you can share these environments with others</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>e.g. you can write a dockerfile that describes how to configure a rails server from scratch, then share that dockerfile with others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can reliably reproduce these environments given a dockerfile</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>4.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2019","path":"/plex-docker-compose","title":"Running a Plex Media Server with Docker Compose","tags":["docker","plex"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/plex-docker-compose","next":null,"previous":null}}
