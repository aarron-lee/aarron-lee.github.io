{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>So recently I have been using docker extensively at work, primarily for setting up/improving a local dev environment, as well as running some containers on AWS ECS.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I initially didn't quite understand what docker was used for. I mean, \"containers\"? Why not just use a VM? But once it really clicked in my head, whoa, containers. They're awesome.</p>\n<p>If I had to distill what I discovered about docker into a few key points, it would be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It lets you create isolated environments (aka containers), each with it's own set of dependencies (aka no more conflicting dependencies!)</li>\n<li>You can configure these environments as a document, and then share these documents with others.</li>\n<li>Given these documents, you can easily and reliably reproduce these environments</li>\n<li>You don't need to manually install dependencies, etc. docker handles that for you!</li>\n<li>Unlike a VM, docker containers are NOT using virtualized hardware, etc. Docker uses cgroups and namespaces to isolate the environments from each other, but they are still directly issuing calls to the host linux kernel. This means containers are more like programs; they spin up fast, are cheap to stop and start, and don't incur the performance overhead of running a virtual machine</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This enables some pretty powerful behavior.</p>\n<p>For example, I can spin up a vanilla linux server with a fresh OS install. Once you install docker on it, you can then feed docker some dockerfiles, it can then use those dockerfiles to spin up a bunch of isolated environments (such as Postgresql, a rails web server, a plex server, pretty much anything with a <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\">dockerfile</a>).</p>\n<p>Each environment will have their own isolated dependencies, and you can even set up networking, port forwarding, etc, between the host machine and these environments! And this is portable to any other linux machine, since all you need on other servers is docker and whatever dockerfiles you used before.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2019","path":"/plex-docker-compose","title":"Running a Plex Media Server with Docker Compose","tags":["docker","plex"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/plex-docker-compose","next":null,"previous":null}}
