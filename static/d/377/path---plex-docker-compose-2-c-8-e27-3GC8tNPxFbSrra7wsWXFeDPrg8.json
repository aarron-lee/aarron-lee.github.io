{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>So recently I have been using docker extensively at work, primarily for setting up/improving a local dev environment, as well as running some containers on AWS ECS.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I initially didn't quite understand what docker was used for. I mean, \"containers\"? Why not just use a VM? But once it really clicked in my head, whoa, containers. They're awesome.</p>\n<p>If I had to distill what I discovered about docker into a few key points, it would be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It lets you create isolated environments, each with it's own set of dependencies (aka no more conflicting dependencies!)</li>\n<li>You can configure these environments as a document, and then share these documents with others.</li>\n<li>Given these documents, you can easily and reliably reproduce these environments</li>\n<li>You don't need to manually install dependencies, etc. docker handles that for you!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This enables some pretty powerful behavior.</p>\n<p>For example, I can spin up a vanilla linux server with a fresh OS install. Once you install docker on it, you can then feed docker some dockerfiles, it can then use those dockerfiles to spin up a bunch of isolated environments (such as Postgresql, a rails web server, a plex server, pretty much anything with a <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\">dockerfile</a>).</p>\n<p>Each environment will have their own isolated dependencies, and you can even set up networking, port forwarding, etc, between the host machine and these environments!</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2019","path":"/plex-docker-compose","title":"Running a Plex Media Server with Docker Compose","tags":["docker","plex"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/plex-docker-compose","next":null,"previous":null}}
